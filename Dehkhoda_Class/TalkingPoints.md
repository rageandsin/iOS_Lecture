Talking Points and Some Notes
=============================

* Core Animation commond gotchas. Fillmode. Stickiness.
* Spinning activity indicators. How this is done, and how I has originally thought it was done. The differences.
* Trigonometry/Geometry recap. Distance/Midpoint/Slope    
* Links to good Apple documentation. Animatable Properties, Class Hierarchy, Class list, etc.
* Animatable properties, what is, what isn't.
* Class hierarchy. Abstract vs. concretely instantitated classes.
* Animations in a 3D space and the implications.
* Gaming is possible using core animation. There isn't necessarily a need for OpenGL when the game is simple.
* UIResponder
